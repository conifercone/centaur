## Reporting a Vulnerability

The centaur team and community take security bugs in centaur seriously. We appreciate your efforts
to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security
Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/conifercone/centaur/security/advisories/new)
tab.

The centaur team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the
initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can
also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by
selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
